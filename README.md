## Key Summary & Sources -
This repository comprises of notebooks and functions required to  scrape football data from fbref.com. A lot of the intrinsic scraping code has been taken from this repository: https://github.com/chmartin/FBref_EPL
The code for the visualisations has been developed from:  
https://github.com/sharmaabhishekk/mpl-footy & https://frankphopkins.medium.com/scraping-fbref-to-perform-comparative-football-player-analysis-cb8a1a2675a6


## Notes -
Player Data + League and Team Data exploration notebooks contains a walk through to aggregating; player per90 statstics, team squad data, league form & standing data from fbref sub pages. 
The functions in these notebooks require specific url in order to work properly. Next steps will include creating my repo of player & team urls to search through and pull programatically. 

Scraping_fucntions.py file contains all the functions written for this project with all steps taken explained.

Check the fbref glossary for any changes in column names. 
These functions only work for teams & players in the top 5 leagues 
The scraper won't work for those leagues which have other columns  Do reach out to me on Twitter or email if there any issues!
